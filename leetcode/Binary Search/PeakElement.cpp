/* question - A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.*/

//so what we do here is we check if mid is peak and if not we go towards higher element to check

class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if(n == 1) return 0;
        if(nums[0]>nums[1]) return 0;
        if(nums[n-1]>nums[n-2]) return n-1;
        int start =1;
        int end = n-2;
        while(start<=end){
            int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
            if(nums[mid]>nums[mid-1] && nums[mid]>nums[mid+1]) return mid;
            else if(nums[mid-1]<nums[mid]){
                start = mid+1;
            }else{
                end = mid -1;
            }
        }return -1;
    }
};
