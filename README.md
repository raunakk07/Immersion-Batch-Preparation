# Immersion-Batch-Preparation
This is a repositry where I post the stuff I learn in my free time.
This will mainly include the questions I solve on leetcode, codechef and the implementation of some Machine learning stuff.
This is a public repositry to showcase that I'm continously working towards something meaningfull and upskilling myself.
